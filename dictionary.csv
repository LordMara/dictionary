"function","In the most general sense, a function is a structuring element in programming languages to group a set of statements so they can be utilized more than once in a program. The only way to accomplish this without functions would be to reuse code by copying it and adapt it to its different context. Using functions usually enhances the comprehensibility and quality of the program. It also lowers the cost for development and maintenance of the software. ","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_functions.php"
"parameter","Is variable in the declaration of function.","http://stackoverflow.com/a/156778"
"variable","A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a computer program. In many programming languages a variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. We can use this variable to tell the computer to save some data in this location or to retrieve some data from this location.","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_variables.php"
"argument","Is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.","http://stackoverflow.com/a/156778"
"dictionary","Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a key: value pair. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.","https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary"
"tuple","A tuple is an immutable list, i.e. a tuple cannot be changed in any way once it has been created. A tuple is defined analogously to lists, except that the set of elements is enclosed in parentheses instead of square brackets. The rules for indices are the same as for lists. Once a tuple has been created, you can't add elements to a tuple or remove elements from a tuple. ","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_sequential_data_types.php"
"ASCII table","Abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII). ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters. ASCII Table represent all characters in easy readable format.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"
"module","A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.","https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html"
"cowboy coding","Is software development where programmers have autonomy over the development process. This includes control of the project's schedule, languages, algorithms, tools, frameworks and coding style.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding"
"python","Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. It name came from Monty Python's Flying Circus.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
"UFT-8","UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters, or code points, defined by Unicode and originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. The encoding is variable-length and uses 8-bit code units. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in the alternative UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings. The name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format – 8-bit.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"
"flowchart","A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart"
"binary","In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one). The base-2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices. Each digit is referred to as a bit.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number"
"interactive shell","Interactive shell is between the user and the operating system (e.g. Linux, Unix, Windows or others). Instead of an operating system an interpreter can be used for a programming language like Python as well. The Python interpreter can be used from an interactive shell. The interactive shell is also interactive in the way that it stands between the commands or actions and their execution. This means the Shell waits for commands from the user, which it executes and returns the result of the execution. After this the shell waits for the next input. A shell in operating systems lies between the kernel of the operating system and the user. It's a ""protection"" in both direction. The user doesn't have to use the complicated basic functions of the OS but is capable of using simple and easier to understand shell commands. The kernel is protected from unintended incorrect usages of system function.","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_interactive.php"
"compiler","A compiler is a computer program that transforms (translates) source code of a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language). In most cases compilers are used to transform source code into executable program, i.e. they translate code from high-level programming languages into low (or lower) level languages, mostly assembly or machine code. ","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_execute_script.php"
"interpreter","An interpreter is a computer program that executes instructions written in a programming language. It can either execute the source code directly or translates the source code in a first step into a more efficient representation and executes this code ","http://www.python-course.eu/python3_execute_script.php"
